# IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
These instructions will help you build IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from source code, which is the basis for IntelliJ Platform development.
The following conventions will be used to refer to directories on your machine:
* `<USER_HOME>` is your home directory.
* `<IDEA_HOME>` is the root directory for the IntelliJ source code.
* `<JDK_16_HOME>` is the root directory for the 1.6 JDK, which is optional.
* `<JDK_18_HOME>` is the root directory for the 1.8 JDK.

## Getting IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Source Code
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition source code is available from `github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community` by either cloning or
downloading a zip file (based on a branch) into `<IDEA_HOME>`. The default is the *master* branch. 

The master branch contains the source code which will be used to create the next major version of IntelliJ IDEA. The branch names
and build numbers for older releases of IntelliJ IDEA can be found on the page of
[Build Number Ranges](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/build_number_ranges.html).

If you intend to make open source contributions to the IntelliJ Platform,
see [Contributing to the IntelliJ Project](http://www.jetbrains.org/display/IJOS/Contribute) for more information.

_**Speed Tip:**_ If the complete repository history isn't needed then using a shallow clone (`git clone --depth 1`) will save significant time.

These Git operations can also be done through the [IntelliJ IDEA user interface](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html).

IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition requires additional Android modules from separate Git repositories. To clone these repositories,
run one of the `getPlugins` scripts located in the `<IDEA_HOME>` directory. These scripts clone their respective *master* branches.
* `getPlugins.sh` for Linux or macOS.
* `getPlugins.bat` for Windows.

_**Note:**_ Always `git checkout` the `intellij-community`, `android`, and `android/tools-base` Git repositories to the same branches/tags. 

## Building IntelliJ Community Edition
Version 2018.2 or newer of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition is required to build and develop
for the IntelliJ Platform.

### Opening the IntelliJ Source Code for Build
Using IntelliJ IDEA **File | Open**, select the `<IDEA_HOME>` directory. 
* If IntelliJ IDEA displays an error about a missing or out of date required plugin (e.g. Kotlin),
  [enable, upgrade, or install that plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html) and restart IntelliJ IDEA.
* If IntelliJ IDEA displays and error about a Gradle configuration not found,
  [refresh the Gradle projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/jetgradle-tool-window.html). 

### IntelliJ Build Configuration
JDK version 1.8 (u91 or newer) is required for building and developing for IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
1. Using IntelliJ IDEA, [configure](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html) a JDK named "**1.8**", pointing to `<JDK_18_HOME>`.
   * If not already present, add `<JDK_18_HOME>/lib/tools.jar` [to the Classpath](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#manage_sdks) tab
     for the **1.8** JDK.
2. Also configure a JDK named "**IDEA jdk**" (case sensitive), pointing to `<JDK_16_HOME>`. If you donâ€™t want to install JDK 1.6
   then you may configure **IDEA jdk** to point to `<JDK_18_HOME>`. However, you must be careful to avoid using Java 8 APIs
   in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition modules that use **IDEA jdk**. 
   * If not already present, add the corresponding path for tools.jar to the Classpath for "**IDEA jdk**" JDK.
3. If the _Maven Integration_ plugin is disabled, [add the path variable](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-projects.html#path-variables)
   "**MAVEN_REPOSITORY**" pointing to `<USER_HOME>/.m2/repository` directory.
4. _**Speed Tip:**_ If you have enough RAM on your computer,
   [configure the compiler settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/specifying-compilation-settings.html)
   to enable the "Compile independent modules in parallel" option. Also set the "User-local build process VM options" to `-Xmx2G`.
   These changes will greatly reduce the compile time.

### Building the IntelliJ Application Source Code
To build IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition from source, choose **Build | Build Project** from the main menu.

To build installation packages, run the `ant` command in `<IDEA_HOME>` directory. See the `build.xml` file for details.

## Running IntelliJ IDEA
To run the IntelliJ IDEA built from source, choose **Run | Run** from the main menu. This will use the preconfigured run configuration "**IDEA**".

To run tests on the build, apply these setting to the **Run | Edit Run Configurations... | Defaults | JUnit** configuration tab:
  * Working dir: `<IDEA_HOME>/bin`
  * VM options: 
    * `-ea` 
    * `-Djava.system.class.loader=com.intellij.util.lang.UrlClassLoader` 
    * `-Didea.config.path=../test-config`
    * `-Didea.system.path=../test-system`

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
